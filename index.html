        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">I'm fascinated by design engineering with interest in aerospace, robotics, guitars, and pretty much everything in-between. Over the last few years I have interned in the Rotorcraft Aeromechanics branch at the NASA Ames Research Center, where I worked with the U.S.A.F / N.A.S at the National Full-scale Aerodynamics Complex. I also have been an intern at the headquaters of Big Ass Fans as well as goBilda/ServoCity/Robotzone. I worked on a few interesting projects, including complete ownership of the design of a rigging rack at NASA, a tool to estimate carbon dioxide concentration in a space for Big Ass Fans, and many others. One of the most fun projcts I worked on was an electric go-kart built from goBilda parts with an estimated top speed of 35mph.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I've been a tinkerer for as long as I can remember. Growing up I was on an FLL lego robotics team, and in highschool I captained FTC robotics team 8417 to be a top 10 team in the world. Those competitions helped grow my passion for solving problems, while exposing me to tools such as CAD and CAM software used alongside 3d printers and a hobby-grade CNC router. In my freshman semester of college I joined the NASA Lunabotics competition team at my university. I quickly made some friends, and in addition to the NASA competition we became interested in starting a Vex U robotics team as well. Due to COVID-19, the new team never got off the ground, the NASA team couldn't compete, and I found other things to do in my freetime.</div>
          <div class="body-text">As of July 2023 I only have one semester of my undergraduate degree left (graduating in December 2023), and I am actively looking for a full-time position in the Lexington area.</div> <!-- Update me!-->
