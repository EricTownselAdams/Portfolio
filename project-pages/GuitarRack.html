          <div class="body-text">In my search of a guitar rack, I found that many of the $30-$50 guitar racks available online were unsatisfactory for many reasons. I designed mine to support the neck of the guitar as close to the nut as I could while accounting for different guitar styles. Additionally, I ensured the headstocks would not overhang the back of the stand. This way, the back of the stand can be placed flush with a wall. Finally, I did this in a cost effective manner, with the project coming in at about $10 (though many existing materials were used)</div>
