However, I can't get past some of the typical features such as the blocky body that digs into my ribs, or the lack of locking tuners on more affordable models.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Enter my take on the telecaster. I included an arm-carve for better comfort, in addition to other changes that are more aesthetic in nature. I also am changing the electronics style to be more like a Gibson guitar, as I don't like the front-facing electronics plate on most telecasters.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Project Status: I have been forced (for this version) to switch to a front-routed electronics cavity to accommodate the challenges I was having with the relatively thin body after the Firebird-esqe stepdown in the middle of the body. Currently, I'm looking to find different wood to make my final body out of (I may switch to Black Limba). I'm worried about a higher-than-normal humidity level in this wood that might lead to stresses in the body causing it to warp over time. Additionally, I'm reevaluating the way that the 9V battery for the active pickups is packaged.</div>
